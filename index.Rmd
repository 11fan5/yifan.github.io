### About me
I am Yifan Shi, currently a second-year MPH Epidemiology student at Columbia University, Mailman School of Public Health. My certificate is Health of an Aging Society, and I am deeply interested in aging, health equity, and health policy. Her research is driven by a commitment to understanding and addressing health disparities, particularly as they affect aging populations. 

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Daniel Belsky](https://www.belskylab.com/) on my thesis, to study the impact of social isolation and loneliness on pace of aging.
